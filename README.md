# Modelling and Implementation of the RV32I ISA in Idris2

This repository contains the source code of the case study used in the paper _A Quantitative Type Approach to Formal
Component-Based System Design_ (accepted by the _Forum on Specification and Design Languages 2024/FDL2024_). 
In this case study, we *manually* modelled the RV32I ISA in Idris2, which is then transformed and implemented.
